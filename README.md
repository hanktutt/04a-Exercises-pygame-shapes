# 04a-Exercises-pygame-shapes

I did a few exercises to get started with using pygame. The first exercise I went through blocks of doee and added comments for what I thought they meant.The second exercise was playing with colors.
The third exercise was creating a clock, and the fourth was supposed to create a circle wherever the user clicks. I went back and updated the 2nd third and fourth exercise and made them opperational.
